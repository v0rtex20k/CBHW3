To run deBruijn.py, simply type:

" $python3 deBruijn.py "

on the command line. To change k or the minimum contig size 
(defaults 31 and 100, respectively), simply scroll to the
bottom of deBruijn.py (lines 128 and 129) and modify their
values. Note that average runtime for the full set of
reads is 10-15 min on average. 

Did not collaborate with anyone on this code or ask
any questions.
